Assignment-1

Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location. Perform following tasks:

Pre-process the dataset.
Identify outliers.
Check the correlation.
Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.
Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

Assignment-3

Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months. Dataset Description: The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.

Perform following steps:

Read the dataset.
Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the data set into training and test sets.
Normalize the train and test data.
Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same.
Print the accuracy score and confusion matrix
Assignment-4

Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the local minima of a function. For example, find the local minima of the function y=(x+3)² starting from the point x=2.
